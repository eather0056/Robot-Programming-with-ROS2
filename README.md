# Robot Programming with ROS2

Welcome to the Robot Programming with ROS2 repository. This repository contains the source code examples and extended project materials based on the book "A Concise Introduction to Robot Programming with ROS2" by Francisco MartÃ­n Rico. This project aims to provide a comprehensive guide and additional resources for readers and practitioners of the book to deepen their understanding of robot programming using ROS2.

## About the Book

"A Concise Introduction to Robot Programming with ROS2" offers readers a structured and clear introduction to robot programming with ROS2.

## Requirements

This repository is tested and maintained for the `foxy-devel` branch, requiring:

- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- ROS2 Foxy Fitzroy

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up your environment and start with the robot programming projects:

### 1. Install Necessary Packages

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl gnupg2 lsb-release
```

### 2. Add ROS 2 Repository Key

```bash
sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg
```

### 3. Add ROS 2 Repository to Sources List

```bash
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(source /etc/os-release && echo $UBUNTU_CODENAME) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null
```

### 4. Install ROS 2 Foxy Packages

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install ros-foxy-desktop
```

### 5. Environment Setup

```bash
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
echo "source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```

### 6. Initialize rosdep

```bash
sudo apt install python3-rosdep2
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update
```

### 7. Create a ROS 2 Workspace

```bash
mkdir -p ~/bookros2_ws/src
cd ~/bookros2_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/eather0056/Robot-Programming-with-ROS2.git
```
<!-- git clone -b foxy-devel https://github.com/fmrico/bookros2.git -->

### 8. Import Third-Party Packages

```bash
cd ~/bookros2_ws/src
sudo apt install python3-vcstool
vcs import . < book_ros2/third_parties.repos
```

### 9. Install Dependencies and Build Packages

```bash
cd ~/bookros2_ws
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions
colcon build --symlink-install
```
